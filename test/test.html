          <p>Are you ready to turn your love for dogs into a rewarding career? Look no
            further! Our comprehensive
            grooming eLearning, called your "Foundation Knowledge," checks what you know, corrects any
            misunderstandings, and introduces you to the new facts and knowledge you will need when you qualify as a
            professional dog groomer.</p>

          <p id="accordion_content_text">This stage of our iPET Network Level 3 Diploma in Dog Grooming and Salon
            Management accounts for around
            1/6th of your
            total qualification time. We aim to get students to complete this before their 1st day of practical
            education or, at the
            latest, their last day at the Academy.</p>
